          <p>In celebration of the District and the <a href="http://www.funkparade.com">Funk Parade</a>, this is the DC Music Project.  We're building a people's history of the city's music and what it means to all of us.
          </p>
          <p>The full site will launch in the comming weeks with everyone's stories for the world to see.</p>
          <p>
          Get involved! Here are 3 ways to make this thing incredible.
          <p>
          <span class="number">[ONE]</span> <a href="/form.html">Tell us your story.</a> What was the first time you heard music performed?  What was your most memorable show? 
          </p>
          <p>
          <span class="number">[TWO]</span> Volunteer!  Come to the next <a href="http://meetup.com/Code-for-DC">Code for DC meetup</a> and help put these stories on the web.  We need coders, writers, graphic designers, musicians, historians, ...you get the idea.
          </p>
          <p>
          <span class="number">[THREE]</span> Partner! Are you an artist or a venue owner? We'd love to add your shows.  Are you a librarian or journalist?  Let's add your archive to the site.  <a href="http://www.twitter.com/mattbailey0">Get in touch!</a>
