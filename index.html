          <h2>dcmusicproject.org</h2>
          <p>In celebration of the District and the first annual <a href="http://www.funkparade.com">Funk Parade</a>, this is the DC Music Project.  In the coming months, we'll build a giant collection of people's memories of the city's music and what it has meant to all of us.
          </p>
          <p>
          Get involved! Here are 3 ways to make this thing incredible.
          <p>
          <span class="number">[ONE]</span> Tell your story! What was the first time you heard music performed?  What was your most memorable show? <a href="/form.html">Tell us your story.</a> We'll put it on a map, share it in an app, and use it to build a people's history.
          </p>
          <p>
          <span class="number">[TWO]</span> Volunteer!  Come to the next <a href="http://meetup.com/Code-for-DC">Code for DC meetup on May 14th</a> and help put these stories on the web.  We need coders, writers, graphic designers, musicians, historians, ...you get the idea.  Everyone has something to contribute.  Don't be shy now.
          </p>
          <p>
          <span class="number">[THREE]</span> Partner! Are you an artist or a venue owner? We'd love to add your shows.  Are you a librarian or journalist?  Let's add your archive to the site.
